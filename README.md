# rpc

RPC is a small remote procedure call library with a focus on building REST-ish APIs that can be natively called from the browser.

Why build yet another RPC library?

1. GRPC support for the web browser is dismal
    
2. GRPC tooling is not fun and not fast

3. GRPC can't run natively in a servless context

4. The Go RPC library focuses on Go to Go services

What is this library trying to do?

1. Be grok-able

2. Be orthogonal

3. Get out of its own way

4. Runnable in a servless context
